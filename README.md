# CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

## Description

This project implements a **CI/CD Pipeline** using **GitHub Actions** for a full-stack application. The pipeline includes:

1. Automatic execution of component tests with **Cypress** when a Pull Request is created for the `develop` branch.
2. Automatic deployment of the application to **Render** when the `develop` branch is merged into the `main` branch.

## User Stories

- **CI for Automated Testing**  
  **As** a developer,  
  **I want** to automatically run Cypress tests when creating a Pull Request to `develop`,  
  **so that** code integrations are clean and meet the requirements.

- **CD for Automatic Deployment**  
  **As** a developer,  
  **I want** to automatically deploy the application to Render when merging `develop` into `main`,  
  **so that** the application is updated with major releases.
